# Italian Hub Resturant Pizza Sales Report

**Unlocking Business Insights with Data Analytics – Pizza Sales Analysis**
Have you ever wondered how restaurants fine-tune their menus to maximize sales and customer satisfaction? In my latest project, I analyzed sales data from "The Italian Hub" (a dummy restaurant) to identify key trends, optimize business strategies, and enhance decision-making. Using Power BI, SQL, and Excel, I turned raw sales data into actionable insights.

Understanding what drives sales in a restaurant is not always straightforward. Some pizzas fly off the shelves, while others struggle to get orders. The goal was to analyze sales patterns, identify the top and bottom-performing items, and uncover trends that could improve business performance.

Data Cleaning and Validation – Missing values, inconsistent records, and unstructured data can lead to misleading conclusions. Ensuring data accuracy was a critical first step.
